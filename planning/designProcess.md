## What is the Engineering Design Process?
During this project, the engineering design process was used to plan, create, and execute the project. It begins with asking questions, then researching, imagining, planning, creating, testing, and improving. This goes in a loop, as more pieces are added in the project.

### Ask
During this phase of the engineering design process, I asked the question that began this project. "How can I create a web extension that can make it more accessible?"
